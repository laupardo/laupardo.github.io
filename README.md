# Objective 
This project aims to develop my personal web page under some guidelines of which technologies to use. These technologies were new to me and this is a way to practice and showcase what I've learned. I decided to focus mainly on what I'm currently most passionate about and showcase it. 

# Tecnologies
HTML5<br>
CSS<br>
JavaScript<br>
Bootstrap

# Description
My food blog web page where I post recipes, and soon reviews of dishes in restaurants. You can also find a random recipe button for when you don't know what to cook. 
Hit me up on all social media @laurispagd.
